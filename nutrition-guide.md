# Simple Guide to Eating for Training and Racing

## Before Training
Make sure "storage tanks" of glycogen are filled before the effort.

| Timing | What to Eat | Examples | What NOT to Do | Notes |
|--------|------------|----------|--------------|-------|
| Night before | Carb-rich meal with plenty of starches | Pasta dinner, rice bowl, potato-based meal | Don't try new foods or spicy/greasy meals; Don't skimp on dinner | Larger portions for intense/longer workouts |
| 2-3 hours before | Moderate carb meal that digests easily | Oatmeal with fruit, toast with honey, rice with light protein | Don't eat high-fiber foods or heavy/fatty meals; Don't skip pre-workout fuel | Smaller portions if you have a sensitive stomach |
| 15-30 minutes before | Small, quick-energy snack (about 20-30g carbs) | Banana, sports drink, energy gel, small granola bar | Don't eat large portions or high-protein/high-fat foods; Don't try new products | Choose something that doesn't upset your stomach |

*For technically-minded athletes: Aim for 7-12g carbohydrate/kg body weight over 24 hours before significant events; 1-4g/kg for the pre-event dinner; 1-4g/kg for the meal 2-3 hours pre-workout (higher end for longer workouts); 0.25-0.5g/kg for the 15-30 minute pre-workout snack.*

## During Training

| Training Type | Duration | How Much to Eat | When to Eat | What to Choose | What NOT to Do |
|---------------|----------|----------------|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| Easy workout | Less than 90 min | Small snack (20-30g carbs) | Midway through | Whatever sits well (sports drink, banana) | Don't force food if you feel fine; Don't try complicated foods |
| Easy longer workout | More than 90 min | 2-3 snacks per hour (60g carbs total) | Every 20-30 minutes | Mix of drinks and solid foods | Don't wait until you're hungry; Don't go the whole time without fuel |
| Hard workout/race | Less than 60 min | Small snack (20-30g carbs) | Halfway through | Quick energy (sports drink, gel) | Don't eat solid food right before high intensity; Don't try new products |
| Interval training | Less than 90 min | 1-2 snacks (30-50g carbs total) | Between hard efforts | Easy-to-consume options | Don't eat during high-intensity intervals; Don't choose heavy foods |
| Race/Hard workout | More than 90 min | 2-3 snacks per hour (60-90g carbs total) | Every 15-20 minutes | Mix of carb sources (sports drinks + gels or chews) | Don't wait too long between fueling; Don't suddenly increase intake on race day |
| Very long event | More than 2.5 hours | 3-4 snacks per hour (90-120g carbs total) | Regular small amounts | Variety of sources (drinks, gels, chews, light solids) | Don't stick to just one type of food; Don't ignore early stomach issues |

*For technically-minded athletes: For exercise >90 minutes, target 30-60g carbs/hour for beginners; 60-90g carbs/hour for experienced athletes with trained guts; up to 90-120g carbs/hour for ultra-endurance events (using 2:1 glucose:fructose ratio when exceeding 60g/hour). For high-intensity interval workouts, aim for 0.5-0.8g carbs/kg/hour.*

**Common Mistakes to Avoid:**
- Waiting until you're hungry or tired to eat (by then it's too late)
- Trying new foods or supplements on race day
- Drinking sports drinks when water would be sufficient (shorter/easier workouts)
- Not having a backup plan if your regular food doesn't work out
- Copying exactly what elite athletes do without testing it for yourself
- Overthinking nutrition and making it more complicated than necessary

## After Training

| Time Until Next Workout | What to Eat | When to Eat | Good Options | What NOT to Do |
|------------------------|------------|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Less than 8 hours | Carb-rich snack or meal with some protein (3:1 ratio) | Within 30-60 minutes after finishing | Recovery shake, chocolate milk, sandwich with lean meat, bowl of cereal with milk | Don't skip recovery nutrition; Don't choose high-fat foods; Don't wait hours to eat |
| Less than 24 hours | Regular meal with good balance of carbs and protein | Within 1-2 hours, then normal meal pattern | Typical balanced meals (meat/protein + rice/potato/pasta + vegetables) | Don't under-eat carbs thinking it's healthier; Don't focus only on protein |
| More than 24 hours | Return to normal eating pattern | No rush - regular mealtimes | Regular balanced meals | Don't restrict calories too much; Don't binge on junk food as a "reward" |

*For technically-minded athletes: For quick recovery (<8 hours until next session), consume 1-1.2g carbohydrate/kg body weight plus 0.3-0.4g protein/kg within the first hour; for <24 hours, aim for 1g carbs/kg across multiple meals over 3-4 hours post-exercise with 0.25g protein/kg; maintain a carb:protein ratio of approximately 3:1 to 4:1 for optimal glycogen synthesis.*

**Tips for Eating During Exercise:**
- Start with smaller amounts and gradually increase as your body adapts
- Stay hydrated - drink 12-24oz (350-700ml) of fluid per hour
- Practice your eating plan during training, not for the first time on race day
- Everyone's body is different - find what works for you through trial and error

**About the Recovery Window:**
- Your body replaces energy stores fastest in the first 30-60 minutes after exercise
- This quick refueling is most important when you have another workout coming soon
- A mix of carbs with some protein works better than just carbs alone
- Liquid options (shakes, smoothies) can be easier to consume when you're not hungry after hard exercise

## Making This Work For You
- Pay attention to how you feel during and after workouts to fine-tune your eating plan
- Try keeping notes about what you eat and how your workouts go
- For personalized advice, consider talking to a sports nutritionist
- These guidelines work for most endurance sports but may need adjustments for your specific activity
